If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

    If we assume that 'audio aura' is an average of energy, valence and danceability then we could use "SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceability) FROM songs;" to get the average for each of these.
    We could then average these three values to get the audio aura which would equal 0.6199876.
    I'm not sure how meaninful this value is on its own, but just comparing the three prior values I would characterise their audio aura as having strong danceability with good energy.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    This way of calculating their audio aura may not be the best because using averages may mean that outliers could skew their results.
    A better way of calculating their aura may be to first remove any strong outliers and then calculating an average, or potentially even using a median instead.
