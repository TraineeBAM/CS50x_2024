You should also create a text file, specification.txt, which lists the 10 HTML tags and 5 CSS properties youâ€™ve used, 
as well as a brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap.

HTML tags:
h1, h2, h3, p, div, audio, footer, a, button, form, table, tr, th, td...

CSS properties:
background-color, background-image, display, margin, color, height, width, grid-template, font-size...

JavaScript:
I chose to use JavaScript to generate a popup that let users know that the form had been submitted successfully.

Bootstrap:
Component positioning.
